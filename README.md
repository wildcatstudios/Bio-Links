Typical link in bio page that redirects to my social media profiles. It was built using HTML + CSS, with the background in <a href="https://www.vantajs.com/">Vanta.js</a> (go check it out, it's amazing). 

#### Benefits of making your own 'link-in-bio' page:
- No data-mining;
- Gives you 100% power to customize your page without relying on pre-built services;
- No annoying Cookie-Policy (it won't steal user's cookies);
- No annoying "Accept/Reject" pop-ups;
- No Trackers (it won't track user's location, IP Address, websites visited, etc);
- No selling-users-data-for-ads kind of thing;
- HTML is fun!

##### Update: Google Fonts link reference is removed from 'index.html' due to no trackers policy. Instead, just upload your own fonts into the "fonts" folder (provided you have a license to use it) and link it in the 'styles.css'.

You can fork this project and create your own link-in-bio/link-tree page, with your own links, profile picture and modifications without notifying me. Credit would be nice though :) You can leave it as "designed/coded by lucas mellone, forked by [your name]" for example.
